## 2023-10-27 - Replace innerHTML with DOM methods to prevent XSS
**Vulnerability:** Use of `innerHTML` in `js/app.js` to render proxy URL error messages, even though `escapeHtml` was used, presents a risk if not careful and goes against the codebase philosophy of avoiding `innerHTML`.
**Learning:** The codebase explicitly documents in `js/ui.js` that `innerHTML` should never be used, as it creates a pathway for XSS if AI-generated text, external data, or user input is rendered. The project provides an `el(tag, attrs, ...children)` helper to create nodes safely.
**Prevention:** Always use `textContent`, `replaceChildren`, or the custom `el` utility when constructing UI elements dynamically in this project.
